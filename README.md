# ard_brewcode
Arduino Brew Code. Reads temperatures using OneWire temperature sensors and modifies heater and pumps based on input setpoints.

Recommended to use an Arduino Mega for memory purposes.

Requires the ArduinoJSON, ArduinoSTL packages.

API:
Communication to/from the brewcode will be via the serial in json format.

Overall commands: 
	{type:general, auto: on[off]} - When on (default), the code will automatically control heaters/pumps using the sensor information. Setting this to off will leave the controllers in their previous state and will rely on manual commands to control switch positions.
	
Heater-specific commands:
	NOTE: Every heater command requires type:heater and one of the following: name:<name_of_heater> or index:<index_of_heater> in the JSON command. Examples below: 
	{type:heater, index:<index_of_heater>, â€¦}, {type:heater, name:<name_of_heater>, ..} 
	The default heater name is "Heater " followed by the index of said heater. For example, the first heater will have the default name "Heater 0". 
	If a user overrides the heater name, he/she must update the JSON command to reflect that. Name is also case-sensitive.
	
	The remaining command definitions will only show the index:<index_of_heater> for brevity.
	
	Also, note that multiple heater commands can be issued at once. The JSON command line fits 256 characters.
	
	{type:heater, index:<index_of_heater>, setpoint_high:<new_setpoint_high_val>} - Updates the heater setpoint_high value.
	
	{type:heater, index:<index_of_heater>, setpoint_low:<new_setpoint_low_val>} - Updates the heater setpoint_lowvalue.
	
	{type:heater, index:<index_of_heater>, setpoint_max:<new_setpoint_max_val>} - Updates the heater setpoint_max value.
	
	{type:heater, index:<index_of_heater>, pin:<new_pin> - Updates the heater to use new_pin as the pin to control.
	
	{type:heater, index:<index_of_heater>, status:<true/false>} - Controls whether the heater is on or off.
	
	{type:heater, index:<index_of_heater>, tsensor_address:<new_tsensor_address>} - Assigns the tsensor at the address "new_tsensor_address" to compare against when controlling the heater. Multiple tsensors can be added if desired.
